User: From now on, I want you to do the following for me in this chat thread. I ask you to make 5 multiple choice questions from the (pdf name) and age (n). Then you answer which n page, and I tell you the page number is n. The questions should be from the pdf and not extra or outside of the pdf, and it should have 5 options with only one correct answer, and the answer should be found in the pdf. The questions and answers must be created based on the information from the pdf and page. Understood?
